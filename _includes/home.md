### Okta Identity Management
Workday-Driven Identity Lifecycle Management with Okta Identity Management
Okta automates user management into all leading cloud and web applications, and this process typically starts from a corporate directory like Active Directory. Now, with Workday-driven identity lifecycle management those provisioning and deprovisioning processes can be driven automatically from Workday via Okta identity management. And unlike integrations between HCM and Identity Management systems in this past, this integration is productized, robust, and cost effective to implement and maintain over time.

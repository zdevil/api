# Event Model

Every organization has a system log that maintains a history of actions performed by users.  The Event model describes a single action that was performed by a set of actors for a set of targets.

## Example

```json
{
    "eventId": "tevIyAytNfpQo-rIZKhUDDRrg1365719153000",
    "published": "2013-04-11T22:25:53.000Z",
    "action": {
        "message": "User performed single sign on to app",
        "categories": [
            "Application Access"
        ],
        "objectType": "app.auth.sso"
    },
    "actors": [
        {
            "id": "00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV",
            "displayName": "Samus Aran",
            "login": "samus.aran@example.com",
            "objectType": "User"
        }
    ],
    "targets": [
        {
            "id": "00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV",
            "displayName": "Samus Aran",
            "login": "samus.aran@example.com",
            "objectType": "User"
        },
        {
            "id": "0oa3gjksodLJFLTUWWHC",
            "displayName": "Okta Administration",
            "objectType": "AppInstance"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Attributes
The Event model is a ***read-only*** object and has a fixed set of attributes:

Attribute | Description | DataType | Nullable
--- | --- | ---	| ---
eventId | Unique key for event | String | FALSE
published | Timestamp when event was published | Date | FALSE
action | Identifies the action that the event describes | [Action Object](#action-object) | FALSE
actors | Describes zero or more entities that performed the action | Array of [Actor Object](#actor-object) | TRUE
targets | Describes zero or more entities that the action was performed against | Array of [Target Object](#target-object) | TRUE

*Note: The actor and/or target of an event is dependant on the action performed. Not all events have an actor or target.*

## Action Object

Describes an activity that published an event

Attribute | Description | DataType | Nullable
--- | --- | ---	| ---
message | Description of an action | String | FALSE
categories | [Categories](#action-categories) for an action | Array of String | FALSE
objectType | Identifies the [unique type](#action-objecttypes) of an action | String | FALSE

*Note: Actions that do not define any categories will have an zero element array value.*

``` json
{
    "message": "User performed single sign on to app",
    "categories": [
        "Application Access"
    ],
    "objectType": "app.auth.sso"
}
```

### Action Categories
